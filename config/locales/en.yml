# Files in the config/locales directory are used for internationalization
# and are automatically loaded by Rails. If you want to use locales other
# than English, add the necessary files in this directory.
#
# To use the locales, use `I18n.t`:
#
#     I18n.t 'hello'
#
# In views, this is aliased to just `t`:
#
#     <%= t('hello') %>
#
# To use a different locale, set it with `I18n.locale`:
#
#     I18n.locale = :es
#
# This would use the information in config/locales/es.yml.
#
# To learn more, please read the Rails Internationalization guide
# available at http://guides.rubyonrails.org/i18n.html.

There are a lot of moving parts to opening this clinic, so we ask that you wait patiently while they all come into place. In the mean time we have created this landing page to keep you all informed on the timeline and any changes that may be taking place. As of right now, we are aiming to open in November 2017 in the down town core. The clinic will be lead by Ayla Andrus who is finishing her examinations and registering with the Collage of Naturopathic Physicians of British Columbia."

She graduated from the Canadian College of Naturopathic Medicine in 2017 with the Degree, Doctor of Naturopathy. She completed her Bachelor of Science at the University of Saskatchewan in 2013, majoring in Anatomy and Cell Biology. She is excited to come home and join the Peace Region community again. She has spent many hours precepting (shadowing) local physicians and health care providers to better understand how to service the community. She looks forward to engaging with residents and local businesses in integrative health care. At the root to any good health plan is tasty food, exercise and love, which she is excited to incorporate into everyday living with Dawson Creek-ers."

      s_one_body: "Naturopathic Medicine is a complementary addition to your current health care team. We work in collaboration with YOU and whoever else may be in your roster. Naturopathy looks at the human body as a whole working system. Unlike common current practices which only focus on one system or worse one symptom, we will get down to the root cause of the problem. We use a natural and scientific approach to improving biochemical and physiological imbalances. We are trained in common medical diagnoses and eastern equivalents. Along with treating specific conditions we also emphasize illness prevention and healthy diet and lifestyle. We pride ourselves in individualized care and realize that what works for one person may not work for another. The most important person in our appointment is YOU, we are simply here to help guide you along the healing journey.\n\nAlright, thats fine and dandy but what does this mean for you?\n\nInitial appointments are an hour long and we generally like to see you after a couple weeks to ensure things are moving in the correct direction. At the base of every plan is diet and lifestyle changes that you and the doctor will plan together to ensure the goals are realistic and attainable for you. Depending on the complaint we will build a specific treatment protocol which can include specific supplementation of vitamins, minerals, plants, herbs or physical therapies. We may also recommend a more integrative approach and refer you for additional treatment from your MD, physiotherapist, chiropractor, acupuncturist, etc. The goal of the treatment plan is to be as sustainable as possible. We would prefer for you to be on as few supplements for as short of time as possible."
      s_two_header: "Treatment"
      s_two_body: "My goal will alway be to be as transparent and open about what to expect from naturopathic medicine. We can help anyone live a healthier, happier and more fulfilling life if they are willing to make the changes. There are some specific areas where Naturopathic Medicine really shines."
